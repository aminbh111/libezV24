16.5.2016 jd

	Increased Release to 0.1.4

	Quick fix for issue #1.

	NOTE: this will be (hopefully) the last release before the 0.2.0
	release!

11.4.2011 jd

	Release 0.1.3

	* strip access rights from created lock file added by
	  Angelo GIRARDI <angelo.girardi@swing.be>. Angelos other idea is
	  implemented in the next release.

	* thanks to Jacques Pelletier <jpelletier@ieee.org> for the fixed
	  typos. His other work will go into the next release.

3.6.2006 jd

	Release 0.1.2

	* after adding 2 patches and some fixes, it is time to release the
	  last release of the 0.1.x tree.

7.10.2004 Celso Kopp Webber <celso@webbertek.com.br>

	* implemented v24GetDSR() and v24GetCTS()
	* added V24_SYNC open flag

9.5.2003 jd

	* add support for debian packages. Note that these two packages (the
	  runtime and the devel package) are unofficial .deb's for woody.

11.4.2003 jd

	* Pascal Bleser <guru@unixtech.be> has made a spec file to build RPM
	  packages. Binary build for SuSE-Linux could be found at
	  http://guru.unixtech.be/rpm/packages/Development/libezV24/.
	  Note: I can't build or test the RPM build process. If you have any
	  questions about RPM's, please contact Pascal Bleser.

11.2.2003 jd

	Release 0.1.1

	* all details on changes are now stored in the the file ChangeLog.

	* fix a Bug in v24CountPorts().

	* v24OpenPort() should now initialize non blocking read correctly.

	* the base name of the static library now ends with a _s!

10.9.2002 jd

	Release 0.1.0

9.9.2002 jd

	* ezV24.c: v24SetParameters() has accidently used c_cflag to mask
	  IGNPAR! This should have been c_iflag. On my Linux system, ISTRIP
	  doesn't strip the parity bit (POSIX like), it strips the 8. bit. So
          I've removed this.
	* manual.dxx: add a sample for v24SetParameters().
	* Makefile: there's no need to install ezV24_conf.h.

20.6.2002 jd

	* ezV24.c: v24Read() now set's V24_E_TIMEOUT if no characters are
	  read. In this case the return value is 0, so it indicates that is
	  no real error. It's part of the application to decide how to handle
	  this. ;-)
	* ezV24.h: doc++ comments updates and error code V24_E_TIMEOUT
	  inserted. The doc++ must be in front of each enum-entry! Fixed for
	  __EZV24_ERROR_CODES.
	* manual.dxx: minor fixes.
	* Makefile*: add target `clean-all' to remove all stuff that is
	  generated. The Makefile for cygwin was missing in the tarball.

12.5.2002 jd

	Release 0.0.4

6.5.2002 jd

	* bug in lockfile handling fixed. The call to buildLockName returns a
	  V24_E_* constant and not --as used before-- a boolean.
	* test-v24.c: i now use -p instead of -c to specify the port name.

2.5.2002 jd

	* add new functions v24SetStopbits() and v24SetRTS().


11.3.2002 jd

	* ezV24.c: v24SetDTR calls ioctrl with status instead of &status.
	* test-v24.c: usage: -c instead of -p to select the port.

24.1.2002 jd

 	* ezV24.c: bufferoverflow in v24Gets() wasn't checked. If the
 	  received string is larger than the passed buffer, the application
 	  crashes. I've forgotten to check the buffersize passed in
 	  `BuffSize'. `BuffSize' must be at least 2.
	* ezV24.h: new error constant V24_E_ILLPARM. Documentation of v24Gets
	  updated.

18.11.2001 jd

	* Release 0.0.3

15.11.2001 jd

	* ezV24.h: include stdlib.h to get the definition of size_t.
	* Add some rudimentary support for the Cygwin 1.3.x toolchain. I know
	  it could be much better, but I'm no windoze-guy.

13.11.2001 jd

	* Makefile: add support to build static libraries.

18.10.2001 jd

	* test-v24.c: minor fixes
	* ezV24.c: v24Gets() miss the `end of string', if there are following
	  characters! In this case, the read() fetch the `end of string' and
	  it isn't the last char in the buffer.
	* Makefile: the install-rule detect existing links now.

25.9.2001 jd

	* Release 0.0.2
	* finished the documentation using DOC++ (http://docpp.sourceforge.net)

18.9.2001 jd

	* start documenting the header.
	* minor typo's fixed.

20.8.2001 jd

	* Release 0.0.1: first release to some testers
